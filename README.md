# CTACheat2: electric boogaloo
Currently under development. All original games implemented.
Except for the 2021 Christmas Special (too short to be worth the effort) and Trouble in Love Land (will be added in a future update?)

A couple of the remake (paid games) will be implemented in a future update. 
I can currently implement CTA 1, 2, and 4. I cannot implement Journey to Catto Land, Requiem or Forever at this moment.
Maybe I should e-beg.
