# Development halted indefinitely
I switched to Linux. Visual Studio does not run under Linux. 
While I could try to migrate it to something like MonoDevelop, it's too much effort for something I will get no support for (0 Euros, 0 downloads, 0 thanks). Plus MonoDevelop was unmaintained from January 2020 until October 4th, 2021 when they finally fired a bullet into the half-dead horse and archived the repository for MonoDevelop. Development may continue in the future. MAY.

# CTACheat2: electric boogaloo
Currently under development. All original games implemented.
Except for the 2021 Christmas Special (too short to be worth the effort) and ~Trouble in Love Land (will be added in a future update?)~
Trouble in Love Land will probably not be supported (because the savegames use JSON and in C#, JSON is a nightmare to deal with)

A couple of the remake (paid games) will be implemented in a future update. 
I can currently implement CTA 1, 2, and 4.
I cannot implement Journey to Catto Land, Requiem or Forever at this moment.
Maybe I should e-beg.

# Special thanks
